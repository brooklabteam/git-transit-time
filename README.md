# git-transit-time

Here is the database for our in-progress GIT transit time paper.

Right now, the repo contains three folders:

- 'GIT-transit-literature' includes the final papers included in our database after going through the results of the database search.
- 'data' includes ths csv file resulting from the review of the papers in the above folder
- 'scripts' has just one R script that processes and models data from the database derived from that review
- 'figures' includes the outputs of the analysis in the R-script
